def log_create():

    Creates a log file with a timestamped name in a directory specific to the script.

    This function generates a log file inside a folder named after the script (nome_arquivo_py).
    The log file's name is based on the current date and time, ensuring uniqueness.
    The folder is created if it does not already exist.
